# musicplayer
 A basic music player with play and stop buttons, created using tkinter for GUI and pygame for audio.

The above program is a basic music player application created using the `tkinter` library in Python. It allows users to play and stop music by providing the file path of the desired music file.

The program starts by importing the necessary libraries: `tkinter` for the GUI and `pygame` for audio playback. It then defines two functions: `play_music()` and `stop_music()`.

The `play_music()` function is called when the user clicks the "Play" button. It retrieves the music file path entered in the entry widget, initializes the `pygame.mixer` module, loads the specified music file using `pygame.mixer.music.load()`, and starts playing it with `pygame.mixer.music.play()`.

The `stop_music()` function is called when the user clicks the "Stop" button. It stops the music playback using `pygame.mixer.music.stop()`.

The program creates the main window using `tkinter.Tk()` and sets its title to "Music Player". It then creates a label and an entry widget for the user to enter the music file path. Additionally, it creates two buttons: "Play" and "Stop", which are associated with the respective functions.

Finally, the program enters the GUI event loop using `window.mainloop()`, which keeps the window open and allows the user to interact with the music player until the window is closed.

To use the music player, the user needs to provide the full path of a music file (e.g., .mp3, .wav) in the entry widget. Clicking the "Play" button will initiate the music playback, and the "Stop" button will halt the playback.
